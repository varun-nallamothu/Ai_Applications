Deanna Davies Any questions ?\\n\\nThis meeting discussed the Fall Program Advisory Committee meeting and the metrics of the program. It was noted that the program has grown significantly since it began five years ago, with 28 part-time faculty members, 100% international students, 61 students in Cornwall, and 133 students enrolled in the program total. It was also noted that the program is 90% international and 10% domestic, with 65% female and 35% male students, and students from all over the world.\", \" , they talked about the importance of the portfolio .

Deanna Davies Meeting adjourned .\\n\\nAt the meeting, Deanna Davies discussed the increase in project management students for the winter of 2023, the importance of inclusivity and belonging, and two big events that happened that fall. The first was a 24-hour event with teams from Jakarta, Holland, South Africa, Kingston, and Cornwall. The second event was a symposium hosted by students for students, with 54 students and 4 faculty members in attendance. The day was full of interaction and included a panel of alumni. The goal is to host the event twice a year, continue to build industry partnerships, and make changes to the capstone program.\", \"'s not the only career that's out there , right ?

Cynthia Egbunonu So this meeting was about a program review that was conducted almost three years ago in the midst of the COVID pandemic. The program is now in an agile format, where they are looking back and making adjustments. They are also in the process of getting accreditation, which can take 12-18 months. The group was excited about the program, and Deanna was praised for her passion, energy, and heart for the program and the students. Patrick was also thanked for his continued support of the program. The group then discussed what is changing in the workplace and what skills/competencies the program should focus on for the students. Finally, Louis shared a report he wrote about how municipalities are forgetting about the employees between entry-level and supervisor and how they can progress professionally without getting into management.\", \" is trying to bring that back and I think that's something that the program should also include . Cynthia Egbunonu Absolutely .\\n\\nThis meeting discussed the need for project management skills in the IT industry, as well as the importance of communication and stakeholder management. The conversation focused on the need for professionals to be able to communicate with different generations, as well as the need for more documentation in the workplace. It was suggested that the program should include micro credentials and certificate programs to make it accessible to domestic students and those who are already employed.\", ' our classroom .\\n\\nThis meeting transcript discussed the importance of communication in the workplace and how it has changed in recent years. It also highlighted the need for different forms of communication to accommodate the five generations in the workforce. Finally, it discussed the rise in mental health issues, addictions, and single parents in society and how this impacts students in the Grad CERT program.', ' business .\\n\\nThis meeting discussed the impact of COVID-19 on students, particularly international students who may be feeling pressure to work more to help with tuition and other expenses. The group discussed the importance of empathy and emotional intelligence in the workplace and in remote work, and they discussed the need to be flexible and accommodating with students who may have babies or other responsibilities that require them to be late or miss class. They also discussed the need to help students manage their time and balance work and school.', '\\n\\nAt this meeting, the stakeholders discussed the trends and opportunities related to the remote work and stakeholder management. They also discussed the administrative part of the meeting, including the new business.

They also discussed the bursary money available for students to write their PMP or micro credentials.
